Experiments with SDL

Yeah, just going to get started.  I've had too much coffee, I have a glass of
wine sitting next to me, and I want to start hacking away and learn something
new.

What I've done so far:

* I'm on Ubuntu 13.04, this fine 2014/01/17 evening.
* I've installed build-essential, cmake, g++
* I've also now got libsdl1.2-dev
* _The Cabin in the Woods_ is running in the background.  There is nothing
  that you can't succeed at once you enter the Whedonverse.  WHEDON IS MY
  MASTER NOW.

Let's get started.
