Experiments with SDL

Yeah, just going to get started.  I've had too much coffee, I have a glass of
wine sitting next to me, and I want to start hacking away and learn something
new.

What I've done so far:

* I'm on Ubuntu 13.04, this fine 2014/01/17 evening.
* I've installed build-essential, cmake, g++
* I've also now got libsdl1.2-dev
* _The Cabin in the Woods_ is running in the background.  There is nothing
  that you can't succeed at once you enter the Whedonverse.  WHEDON IS MY
  MASTER NOW.
* After some more wine and a bit of violin practice, I went ahead and added
  libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev, which should 
  allow me to get deeper into the tutorial (and refactor that stuff to be
  relatively OO).

Let's get started.

Some additional things that I'm learning:

* Need to init my screen before I start loading the images.
* _Princess Mononoke_ does not make a good background movie while programming.

Starting with lesson three, I've also installed the following:

* libsdl-image1.2-dev
* libsdl-mixer1.2-dev

Oddly, turned out they were already installed...  Moving on.
